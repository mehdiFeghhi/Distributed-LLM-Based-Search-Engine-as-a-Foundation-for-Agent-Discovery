You have a list of agents provided in a markdown table. Based on the user's needs or requirements, suggest a list of relevant agents from this table in JSON format. 

**Instructions:**
1. Read the user's prompt to understand their needs.
2. Reference the markdown table to identify agents that match the user's needs.
3. Generate a JSON object with the following structure:
    - **"agents"**: An array of objects where each object represents an agent.
        - Each object should have:
            - **"name"**: The name of the agent (e.g., "Data Scientist").
            - **"description"**: A brief description of what the agent does (e.g., "Analyzes and interprets complex data.").

4. If no agents match the user's needs, return an empty JSON object:

```json
{
  "agents": []
}
```
Example:

If the user prompt is: "Iâ€™m looking for an agent that helps with data analysis and interpretation."

And you find matching agents, the JSON response should be:
```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "Data Scientist",
      "description": "Analyzes and interprets complex data."
    }
  ]
}
```
If no agents match the needs, the JSON response should be:

```json
{
  "agents": []
}
```
