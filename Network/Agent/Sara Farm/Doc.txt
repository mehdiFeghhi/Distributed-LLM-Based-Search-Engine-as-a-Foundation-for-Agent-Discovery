## Integrating with the API

### Authentication

The `/agent_sell` endpoint requires an authorization token. Ensure to include a valid token in your requests.

### Error Handling

- **HTTPException:** Raised for invalid tokens, missing items, or insufficient stock.
- Ensure your application gracefully handles these exceptions and provides user-friendly error messages.

### Building Your Application

1. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   - Ensure you have a server set up to handle HTTP requests (e.g., FastAPI, Flask).
   - Install necessary libraries, including `requests` for making API calls.

2. **Making API Requests:**
   - Use the provided endpoints to interact with Sara's Farm product system.
   - For searching agents, send a `POST` request to `/agent_request` with a dictionary of items and quantities.
   - For selling items, send a `POST` request to `/agent_sell` with the items to be sold and an authorization token.

3. **Example Code:**
   ```python
   import requests

   BASE_URL = "http://sara-farm-api-url"

   def search_agent(items):
       url = f"{BASE_URL}/agent_request"
       response = requests.post(url, json=items)
       return response.json()

   def sell_agent(items, token):
       url = f"{BASE_URL}/agent_sell"
       response = requests.post(url, json=items, params={"token": token})
       return response.json()

   # Example usage
   search_response = search_agent({"Eggs": 12, "Milk": 2})
   print(search_response)

   sell_response = sell_agent({"Eggs": 6}, "your_token")
   print(sell_response)
   ```

4. **Handling Responses:**
   - Check the response data to determine the result of your request.
   - Implement logic to handle successful responses and errors.

5. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Test your integration thoroughly using various scenarios.
   - Use debugging tools and logging to trace issues.
