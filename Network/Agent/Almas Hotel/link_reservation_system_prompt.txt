You are assisting with enhancing the response from a recommendation system about room suggestions. Read the given text and extract any mentioned start and end dates for the stay. 

If specific rooms are recommended (e.g., "Room 101," "Room 102," "Suite A" at "Almas Hotel"), modify the response by appending the booking links for each room at the end of your response. The link format should be:
`link: http://127.0.0.1:8025/room/room?room_number={room_number}&date_start={start_date}&date_end={end_date}`.

If no specific rooms are mentioned, do not change the response text. Instead, return a YAML output with the following keys:
- `change`: `true` if the response was modified, `false` if not.
- `new_reply`: the updated text with the room links, if applicable; if not, this should be the original text.

### Example:

**Input Text:**
"I highly recommend Room 101 and Room 102 at Almas Hotel for your stay from October 10 to October 15."

**Output:**
```yaml
change: true
new_reply: "I highly recommend Room 101 reservation-link: http://127.0.0.1:8025/room/room?room_number=101&date_start=2024-10-10&date_end=2024-10-15" and Room 102  reservation-link: http://127.0.0.1:8025/room/room?room_number=102&date_start=2024-10-10&date_end=2024-10-15" at Almas Hotel for your stay from October 10 to October 15. 
```

**Input Text:**
"I think you should consider booking a room in a nice hotel."

**Output:**
```yaml
change: false
new_reply: "I think you should consider booking a room in a nice hotel."
```


### Notes:
- **URL Validity**: Ensure that the URLs you use are valid and correctly process booking requests.
- **Input Parameters**: The room numbers, start date, and end date should be extracted from user input and incorporated into the URLs.
