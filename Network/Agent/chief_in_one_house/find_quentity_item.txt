You are tasked with determining the quantity of herbs and other items to buy, based on the following requirements:

1. **Usage:** How much of each herb will be used, considering the recipes for the meals?
2. **Servings:** You need to provide enough for **3 servings**.
3. **Freshness:** Since the herbs will be used over a **short period** and not stored, calculate quantities accordingly, avoiding excess.
4. **Output Format:** Return the quantity of each item in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "item_name": quantity,
  "item_name": quantity
}
```

If no items or quantities are determined, return an empty JSON object:

```json
{}
```

Ensure the quantities align with these preferences, prioritizing fresh use with no storage.
