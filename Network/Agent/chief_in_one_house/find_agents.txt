Your task is to analyze the provided agent table and determine which agent(s) are capable of fulfilling the requirements based on the job description and the list of items to be acquired.

### Instructions:
1. Review the agent table provided in the prompt.
2. Each agent has associated attributes such as their name, active status, and the items they can provide.
3. Based on the job description and the required items, identify all agents that can help fulfill these needs.
4. Generate a response in JSON format, which includes:
   - An array of matching agents, where each agent is represented by an object containing their name and any relevant details.
   - If no matching agents are found, return an empty array.

### Example JSON response format:
```json
{
    "matching_agents": [
        {
            "name": "Agent 1",
            "IP_Address" : "Agent 1 IP Address",
            "Port" : "Agent 1 Port"
        },
        {
            "name": "Agent 2",
            "IP_Address" : "Agent 2 IP Address",
            "Port" : "Agent 2 Port"
            
        }
    ]
}
