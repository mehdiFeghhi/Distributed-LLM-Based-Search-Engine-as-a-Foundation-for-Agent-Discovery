You have a table of available foods and a list of items needed for a meal. Determine if all required items are available to prepare the meal. Please return the result in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "status": "Completed" | "Not completed",
  "missing_items": ["item1", "item2", "item3"]
}
```

- Set `"status"` to `"Completed"` if all required items are available, or `"Not completed"` if any items are missing.
- List any missing items in `"missing_items"`, or use an empty list if all items are available.

Ensure the JSON response is well-structured and clearly indicates whether the meal requirements are fully met.
